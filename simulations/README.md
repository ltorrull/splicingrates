*simulations/* Files for the simulations conducted in Pai *et al.* eLife 2017

- simulation.R : simulate nascent 4sU-seq reads across timepoints, genomic, and library parameters
- miso_modeling.R : simulation of PSI decreate method, where inputs are MISO summary PSI values computed with reads from simulation.R
- junction_modeling.R : simulation of junction dynamics method, where inputs are reads output from simulation.R
